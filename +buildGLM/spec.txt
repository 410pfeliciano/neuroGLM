== Experiment Struct
A collection of Trials. Trials are sections of continuous recording.

.global.unitOfTime: 'string' - represent the unit of time
.global.binSize: [1] - duration of a time bin
.global.id: 'string' - unique ID for the experiment
.meta.desc.fieldname: 'string' - longer description
.meta.type.fieldname: 'string' - continuous/timing/spike train/value
.meta.dim.fieldname: [1] - dimension of corresponding continuous data
.trial(k).fieldname: [1] or [n] or [n x p x ...]
.trial(k).meta: (any) - any meta data associated with the trial
.trial(k).duration: [1] duration of this trial

All timings within the trial are relative -- beginning of the trial is 0,
and do not exceed the duration of the trial. The number of bins within a
trial is `ceil(duration/binSize)`.
    
== DesignSpec
Tells you how to form the design matrix for analysis from the Experiment.

.covar(k).label 'str' - short description of the covariate
.covar(k).desc 'str' optional - long description of the covariate
.covar(k).cond: @(expt, trial) -> boolean
.covar(k).value: @(expt, trial) -> (1)
.covar(k).basis: Basis Struct (see below)
.covar(k).plotOpts: {} (option) - for consistent plotting

== Basis Struct

.edim: [1] - number of columns it expands to in the design matrix
.handle: @(trial, nT) -> [nT x edim] (sparse)
